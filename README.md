# sokoban
This project is a functional Sokoban game. I created a user interface for the game, which is displays the game‬ level in an SFML window. I used a 2D vector to store the level data and a‬ switch statement to handle the visuals of the game elements, such as walls,‬ boxes, and the player. I made the game functional by implementing‬ player movement and collision detection. I handled both player movement and‬ interactions with boxes through a series of conditions, ensuring the player‬ could push boxes around and win the game once all boxes were placed in their‬ designated storage areas. I also added features like player orientation‬ changes during movement and sound effects when the game was won.
